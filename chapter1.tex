\section{Introduction}
The most important concept in Category Theory is that of universal property. Universal properties state how the object being described relates to the entire universe in which it lives.

\begin{example}
    Let $1$ denote a set with one element. The $1$ has the following property:
\end{example}
\begin{center}
for all sets $X$, there exists a unique map from $X$ to $1$.
\end{center}
Indeed, let $X$ be a set. There \textit{exists} a map $X\to 1$, because we can define $f:X\to 1$ by taking $f(x)$ to be the single element of $1$ for each $x\in X$. This is the \textit{unique} map $X\to 1$, because there is no choice in the matter: any map $X\to 1$ must send each elemet of $X$ to the single element of $1$.

There can be only \textit{one} object satisfying a universal property in the sense that if two objects satisfy the property, then they are isomorphic.
